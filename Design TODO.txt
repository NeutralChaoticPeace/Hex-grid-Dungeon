TODO:

1.	Hex Grid Major Upgrade:

	1.1	Reimplemented HexGrid using logic from:
			"www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/implementation.html"
			// This will clean up and polish the hexagon class substantially.
		
	1.2	Update the dungeon/room generation code to use the changed hexclass.
	
	1.3	Update the drawing code to adjust for the new hex class.
			In particular, make use of the map and layout classes as needed to support a future game.
			
	1.4	Check that the random class works given a seed. (can hardcode this at compile time if needed).
			//This is what lets us create maps procedurally, not randomly.
